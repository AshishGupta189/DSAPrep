    /*Q.3
        What is the significance of using the final keyword with the following programming
        constructs.
        a. variable
        b. method
        c. class

        => Final keyword is related to variable,class and methods.
        final Variable:
        when we declare a variable with final keyword like final int x=10;
        then we cant reassign valur to x. it will give us an CT error.
        so final variable acts like const in js, and we can't reassign value to final variable.
        The significance of using final keyword with variable is:
        to make our variable unchangeable so that no one can change the variable.
        we can store our passwords with final keyword so that no one literally can change the password.

        final method:
        when we declare a method with final keyword like void calculate(){sout("HII")}
        now if we want to override the method declared with final keyword you
        can't override the method and if you try then it will be CT error.
        The significance of using final keyword with method is:
         to make the method unchangeable so that no one can override our methods.
         we can use this method to calculate some process of products using various techniques which
         we don't want to be changes by anyone.


         final class:
         when we declare a class with final keyword, so we can't extend the class and if you try
         to do it, so again it will give us CT error.
         The significance of using class with final keyword is:
         so that no one can inherit the properties of final class
         we can use this class to store data which we don't want anyone to inherit the properties of the final class.
