    * When should you use LinkedList over ArrayList?
    *
    * =>We should use Linkedlist over ArrayList when we need to insert or delete any item because in linkedlist inserting
    * or deleting any item is much easier,this because in Arraylist if we insert or delete ant item in the worst case we need
    * traverse the whole array nut this is not so in Linkedlist,
    * ArrayList is effective over linkedlist when we want to access because it can access bt indexes.
