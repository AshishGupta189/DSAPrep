1. Explain the difference between == operator and equals() method
with a code example.
=> == operator compares the address of the datatype while equals () method 
compares the content provided but not the string.

ex: String str="xyz";
	  String str2="xyz";
		sout(str==str2) //true, sout(str.equals(str2))//true
		so here we are using a string literal and the value is the same so both String 
will be assigned to the same address. and if we print(str==str2) it will give me 
output as true but when we use new keyword new address is assigned

String s1=new String("value");
String s2=new String("value");
sout(s1==s2)//false , sout(s1.equals(s2)) //true

here addresses are different but the value is the same so the == operator gives false while
equals ()method gives true;

2. What do you understand by “Java Strings are immutable”.
Explain the advantages and disadvantages of immutability of
Strings
=> Java Strings are immutable means they can be unchanged or constant we can't
change its value what we can do is to reassign it to a new value without
destroying the initial value.

ex: String s1="new"; //here we have assigned an initial value to s1;
String temp=s1; //we have given temp's value as s1's value.
//now we are going to reassign the value to s1.
s1=s1+s1;//new value of s1 becomes newnew but new value is also there.
//even at this place the value of temp is same as new.

sout(s1)//newnew
sout(temp)//new

so by this we can say that Java Strings are immutable.

Advantages:	if someone from outside wants to change the information in our
code such as password or something so due to immutability he or she can't do it
which makes Java a very secure language.

Disadvantage: Suppose we are travelling on an airline and we are keeping the
data of latitude and longitude in our string so in a very short period of time
the creation of string is very much so it will be very messy to get the data
It's the disadvantage of immutability.


7. Explain the concept of static in Java.
=> Static generally refers to global such as global methods or variables,
you can use these variables or methods ver simply by just typing it name.
Static variables or methods are loaded before the code is executed while non
static are loaded only when it is needed.
static is related to class and variables. It takes less memory because it is 
loaded in the memory only once while dynamic loading loads all the time needed.
if we make any variable or method static in java so it'll be loaded in the 
memory where it may or may not be executed.In Java our maun method is always 
static and it's the only entry point to the code.
Static in java plays a very important role without it our main methods is 
incomplete and without main method we can't run our java programs.

3. Explain has-A relationship with a code example.
=> we have created a class in java named as Animal and we are exteding Animal
class with Dog and inheriting the properties of Animals to Dog. so Dog will 
get all the property of Animal along with his own properties.
here we can say that 
Dog has a relationship with Animal.

ex:
class Animal{
void eat(){
sout("I can eat");
}
int age=4;
String category="Animal";
int legs =4;
}
//this is an animal class

class Dog extends Animal{//here all the properties of animal is inherited by 
dog and we can also override the method or int by giving the same name

int age=10;
void eat(){
sout("Dog can eat")
} //it's always mandatory to use @override before overriding any method.
}

now i can access all the properties of dog's itself and animal one' too.
so here Dog has-A relationship.
