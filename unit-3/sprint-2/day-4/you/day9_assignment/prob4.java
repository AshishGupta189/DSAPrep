    /*Q4) Explain the difference between overloading and overriding methods with an example?*/

    /*Method Over Loading also known as Static Binding and complie time polymorphism is a method
    in which we overload a method by giving different argument list and we know it in complie
    time that which method is going to be called.
    Rules of Overloading:
    1. Name of methods may or may not be same.
    2. Argument lists should be different.
    3. Return type can be same or different.
    while
    Method overriding also known as dynamic binding and run time polymorphism is a method in which we
    override a method and inthis argument lists are same and we know it in run time that the method is going to be called
    Rules of Overriding:
    1.Name should be same.
    2.Argument list should be same.
    3. There should be is A relationship.
    4. It's recommended to use @override while overriding
