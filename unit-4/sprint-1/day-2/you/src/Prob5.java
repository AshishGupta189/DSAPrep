	 * Q5/- Explain about the Method Reference, How many ways we can refer to an
	 * existing implementation explain with examples.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Method Refrence is a method in which we use the method which is suitable for the class.
	 * It is a shortcut or simplified form of Lambda Expression.
	 * It is represented by :: double colon symbol
	 * 
	 * We can refer to an existing implementation in 3 ways:
	 * 1> non static method -> object::methodName;
	 * 2> static method -> className :: methodname;
	 * 3> constructor -> className:: new;
	 * 
	 * Note: when there any return statement is present we cant use Method refrence using consructor.
	 * 
	 * Thankyou.. :)
