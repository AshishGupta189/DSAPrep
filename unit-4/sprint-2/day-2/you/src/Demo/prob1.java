//Q1) What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?
	
	/* Multithreading is a concept by which we can run multiple programs at a time
	 * and increase the productivity. It gives time to all the method by Scheduler 
	 * and within that time lapse only that function is running.\\
	 * 
	 * It is impotant to use the idle state of CPU
	 * it is mainly used for independency on methods
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 2) What are the benefits of using Multithreading?
	 * => It is impotant to use the idle state of CPU.
	 * it is mainly used for independency on methods
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Q3) Differentiate between process and thread.
	 * => Process means any program in execution while thread is a segment of process.
	 * process takes more time to operate while thread takes less time.
	 * process is used for heavy objects while thread is used for small.
	 * process doesnt share data while thread does with each other
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Q4) What are the different states of a thread, or what is thread lifecycle?
	 * 
	 * => the different states of a thread are:
	 * New State
	 * Runnable state
	 * Running state
	 * block state
	 * dead state
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Q5) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a Thread?
	 * =>
	 * Using thread  we cant extend the class other than thread while creating with Interfaces 
	 * we can do so.
	 * for thread we use extend keyword but for interface we use implements
	 * 
	 * in thread we can easily define the variable obj of thread but in interface we need to conver
	 * obj to thread class.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Q6) What if we call Java run() method directly instead start() method?
	 * => if we call java run method instead of start method we are making our program single threaded 
	 * first application stops then second is going to be invoked.
	 * by start method we make our program run in multithreaded application.
