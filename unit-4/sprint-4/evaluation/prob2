Q2/- How many types of relationships exist among tables in the
Database? Explain with some examples, and also mention how to
establish these relationships among tables with examples.


At table level we have three types of relationship:

- one to one
- one to many
- many to many

in one to one relationship we have only relation between the two.
ex: a person can have on;y one dl and one dl can have only one person.
if we want to establish otm we need to use foreign keyword and unique keywird also.

create table person(
    pid int pk,
    pname varchar(10),
    email varchar(210)
)


create table dl(

    dlid int pk,
    issue date,

    pid int unique,

    fk(pid) references person(pid)

)



one to many


one to many means a person can use multiple assests but multiple assests can be used by that only person
ex: person:mobile,car,bike,/father-child,school-student.
we dont use unique keyword while establishing one to many relationship.

create table person(
    pid int pk,
    pname varchar(10),
    email varchar(210)
)


create table mobile(

    dlid int pk,
    issue date,

    pid int,

    fk(pid) references person(pid)

)
create table bike(

    dlid int pk,
    issue date,

    pid int,

    fk(pid) references person(pid)

)

create table car(

    dlid int pk,
    issue date,

    pid int,

    fk(pid) references person(pid)

)






many to many


we can use many assests and many assests can be used by many perosons.
ex:movie-actor,book-author,student course.

create table student(
    int id pk,
    STring name,
    String marks,
)

create table course(
    int id pk,
    String name,
    int fee
)

create table link(
    int cid,
    int sid,
    fk(cid) refrences student(id),
    fk(sid) references course(id)
)
